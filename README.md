Code for a WGAN implementation in JAX and Equinox. Referenced DVD-GAN paper for architecture. Includes dataset of Twitch emotes. The data_collection folder contains scripts to collect the gifs yourself. Run Trainer.py to train the model. Currently, I have not found a stable training configuration. Generated examples will be posted in the [GH page](https://dx-li.github.io/emotegan/index.html).
